As of yet Untitled Mad Max Story

Changelog - 12/6/15 - Dustin
	Laughed at some of my dumb mistakes that Kevin pointed out
	Moved Play Again from Choice 6 to new choices added by Quin
	Played through twice to search for typos
		Found a few and fixed them, but not a thorough search
	Fixed broken link trying to go to "stopcaraftermathdriving" rather than "stopaftermathdriving"
    Fixed leftovers from manual merge
    Fixed flair in ignoretown

Changelog - 12/6/15 - Kevin
	Fixed a few typos
	Made the choice links consistent in capitalization, length, & punctuation
	Moved the [[Play again?]] links to the choice6 aftermaths
	Re-deleted ariddesert passage

Changelog - 12/5/15 - Kevin
	Removed ariddesert descriptor passage for consistency. Might add a couple of those later (tomorrow)
	Added all text for Choice 2
	Deleted some links that could never be followed in Choice 2
		e.g.
			(elseif: $moral < 50)
				(set: $moral to $moral - 5)
				(if: $moral > 50)
	Added all text for Choice 4
	Reworked stopcardriving
		Decreased the overall morality drop for stopping then killing (25 to 10), just killing them in the car is 20
		Increased the morality needed to comply because it was previously impossible to kill them
			(if: $moral > 55) -> stopcardriving
				before:
					(set: $moral to $moral - 30)
					(if: $moral > 25) -> complydriving
					(else:) -> killallpulledoverdriving
				after
					(set: $moral to $moral - 15)
					(if: $moral > 45) -> complydriving
					(else:) -> killallpulledoverdriving
		Removed the possibility of pulling over and then the character killing the raiders when told to comply (it was impossible)
			(if: $moral > 55) -> stopcardriving
				(set: $moral to $moral + 5)
				(if: $moral > 25) -> complydriving
				(else:) -> killallpulledoverdriving
		Reworked accelerateaftermathdriving to make all of the choices possible, & deleted some impossible ones

Changelog - 12/5/15 - Quin
